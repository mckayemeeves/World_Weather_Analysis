# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose of Analyis
The purpose of this project is to analyze weather around the world and create a trip planner that includes weather descriptions. Beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which are then used to idetify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. They can then choose four cities to create a travel itenerary. Using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route is created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
